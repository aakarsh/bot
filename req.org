Description

Lab 4 consists of integrating your code from lab 2 with your code from
lab 3. In other words, you will make your creature move across 3-D
terrain. For this lab there are new texture and skin files to use for
the terrain, but there is no starter code, as you'll be re-using your
code from labs 2 and 3. The specifics of what you need to implement
are listed in the criteria section below. This lab is out of 65
points, with a maximum possible score of 70/65.

Files

The lab 4 terrain and skin files have been posted on the eCommons page
under "Resources" (link). Apparently we can't attach files to course
web pages any more :(. If you don't have eCommons access email the TA:

Tips & Guidelines

Starting from your lab 3 code is probably easiest.

Try to set things up so that you can just call draw_terrain (or
whatever function you used in lab 3 to draw the heightmap) and then
translate, rotate, and scale before calling draw_animal (or whatever
function you used in lab 2 to draw your animal).

This means that your draw_animal function will have to be completely
independent.

Note that to use the new terrain and skin files you'll need to make
sure that your code doesn't depend on the size of the old terrain/skin
files from lab 3 (i.e. you probably shouldn't be dividing by 512
anywhere, instead use "((float)terrain.width)" ).

Also note that you don't need to make lighting work for your animal.

5 Animal from lab 2 is working.
5 Height map with normals and texture from lab 3 is working.
5 Animal is drawn along with terrain.

5 Animal is at an appropriate scale
  (the size of 1-3 grid cells of the terrain).
  
10 Animal is at the correct height to stand on the terrain.
   This does not need to be perfect, but the body of the animal
   should be just above the terrain, while the legs (or other apendeges)
   should be touching the terrain. Moslty submerged
   or obviously floating positions will not get full credit.
   
5 The animal is rotated according to the normal of the terrain wherever it is placed.
10 The animal moves across the terrain while animating, either randomly or on a fixed path.
5 Multiple (at least 3) copies of the animal are displayed.
5 Provide a control that causes the camera to look at your animal and allows the user to cycle through looking at each copy.
5 The copies of the animal move independently along different paths (or using different random walks).
5 Provide controls that can start, pause, and reset the motion of your animals.
5 Provide a help message that explains the controls of your program.
